# meetups

This is a simple app which introduces you to the MEAN stack as the full stack.
This app just shows a list of strings as you input in the textbox.

To run it on your local you can clone this repo and then
    point directory in command line to the folder you have cloned and
    type npm install
    Now that all dependencies are loaded just run node server
    Hoping that you dont get any errors you can open your browser
    And go to http://localhost:3000
    Voila!! You have just ran your MEAN appliction.
    
    
P.S. : I have assumed that you have mongodb setup and it is running on 27017 with the db name as mean-db
